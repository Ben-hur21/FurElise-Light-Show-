# Beethoven's "Fur Elise" - A Multisensory Light & Sound Installation

### Project Overview
This project merges classical music with modern technology to create a multisensory experience, engaging both auditory and visual senses. By programming an Arduino to play Beethoven’s timeless "Für Elise" alongside synchronized LED lights, this installation transforms the piece into a contemporary art experience that bridges the gap between sight and sound.

### Motivation
The choice of "Für Elise" was intentional. Its delicate, haunting melody serves as an ideal foundation to explore the relationship between sound and light. Each note not only produces a sound but also triggers a corresponding LED, visually representing the rhythm and emotion of the composition. Through this installation, traditional music meets cutting-edge technology, allowing the audience to experience "Für Elise" as both a musical and a visual composition.

### Features
- **Sound & Light Synchronization**: Each LED is programmed to illuminate in sync with specific notes, creating a visual accompaniment to the music.
- **Visual Rhythm**: The LED display visually mirrors the music’s rhythm and emotion, enhancing the listener’s experience by providing a tangible connection to the music.
- **Engaging & Immersive**: Designed to captivate and engross the audience, transforming “Für Elise” into a dynamic, multisensory artwork.

### Goals
This project is a tribute to the profound impact of music and technology in evoking emotions and creating immersive experiences. It highlights the potential for traditional art forms to be reimagined and experienced in innovative ways. As an interactive installation, it seeks to spark curiosity and inspire others to explore the possibilities that arise from merging classical art with modern technology.

## Installation & Setup
